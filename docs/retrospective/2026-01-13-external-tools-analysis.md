# External Tools Analysis - Retrospective

**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Task**: Analyze planning-with-files and superpowers to identify improvements for multi-agent-ralph-loop
**Complexity**: 6 (Medium - Research and Analysis)
**Models Used**: Claude Opus 4.5

---

## Summary

Analysis of two popular Claude Code workflow tools:
1. **planning-with-files** (OthmanAdi) - Manus-style persistent markdown planning
2. **superpowers** (obra) - Complete software development workflow with TDD

Both tools offer complementary patterns that can enrich multi-agent-ralph-loop.

---

## Analysis: planning-with-files

### Core Concept
Implements the "Context Engineering" pattern that made Manus worth $2B: treating filesystem as persistent memory and context window as volatile RAM.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description | Ralph Equivalent |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **3-File Pattern** | task_plan.md + findings.md + progress.md | Ledger + Handoff system |
| **2-Action Rule** | Save findings after every 2 operations | No direct equivalent |
| **PreToolUse Hook** | Re-read plan before major decisions | Partial (PostToolUse only) |
| **Stop Hook** | Verify completion before stopping | No direct equivalent |
| **Error Logging** | Track failures to avoid repetition | No direct equivalent |

### What Ralph Could Adopt

1. **The 2-Action Rule**
   - Current: No intermediate save triggers
   - Proposed: Auto-save context after N tool uses (configurable)
   - Impact: HIGH - Prevents context loss mid-task

2. **PreToolUse Plan Re-read Hook**
   - Current: Only PostToolUse hooks
   - Proposed: Add PreToolUse hook to re-read plan before critical operations
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Reduces goal drift

3. **Dedicated Findings File**
   - Current: Everything goes to ledger
   - Proposed: Separate research findings from execution state
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Better context organization

4. **Stop Hook Verification**
   - Current: VERIFIED_DONE is manual
   - Proposed: Automatic completion checklist before Stop
   - Impact: HIGH - Ensures true completion

## Analysis: superpowers

### Core Concept
Complete workflow orchestration with emphasis on TDD, Socratic design refinement, and subagent-driven development with two-stage code review.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description | Ralph Equivalent |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Brainstorming Phase** | Socratic questioning before design | /clarify (partial) |
| **Two-Stage Review** | Spec compliance THEN code quality | Single-stage /adversarial |
| **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR** | Strict TDD enforcement | Not enforced |
| **Subagent-Driven Dev** | Fresh subagent per task | Task() subagents |
| **Systematic Debugging** | 4-phase root cause process | Not specified |
| **3-Fix Rule** | Stop after 3 failed fixes | Not enforced |
| **Plan Document Format** | 2-5 min tasks with exact code | Higher-level plans |

### What Ralph Could Adopt

1. **Two-Stage Code Review**
   - Current: Single adversarial validation
   - Proposed: Stage 1 (spec compliance) -> Stage 2 (code quality)
   - Impact: HIGH - Catches more issues, clearer feedback

2. **Strict TDD Enforcement**
   - Current: Testing is recommended but not enforced
   - Proposed: Add TDD skill with "delete code written before tests" rule
   - Impact: HIGH - Better code quality

3. **Systematic Debugging Skill**
   - Current: No structured debugging approach
   - Proposed: 4-phase mandatory debugging (root cause -> patterns -> hypothesis -> fix)
   - Impact: HIGH - 95% first-time fix rate vs 40% ad-hoc

4. **The 3-Fix Rule**
   - Current: Unlimited fix attempts
   - Proposed: After 3 failed fixes, escalate to user (architectural issue)
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Prevents endless loops

5. **Granular Task Format**
   - Current: High-level plans
   - Proposed: 2-5 minute tasks with exact file paths and code
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Better subagent execution

6. **Brainstorming Skill Enhancement**
   - Current: /clarify focuses on requirements
   - Proposed: Add Socratic design exploration (2-3 alternatives with trade-offs)
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Better architecture decisions

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
1. Create `systematic-debugging` skill
2. Add TDD enforcement to existing workflow
3. Implement 3-fix rule in Ralph Loop

### Phase 2 (Short-term)
1. Add two-stage review to /adversarial
2. Enhance /clarify with Socratic exploration
3. Create Stop hook for verification

### Phase 3 (Medium-term)
1. Implement 2-Action Rule
2. Separate findings from ledger
3. Add PreToolUse plan re-read hook

## What Went Well

- Multi-model routing (unique to Ralph) - neither tool has this
- Context preservation is more automatic than both tools
- Quality gates cover more languages than superpowers
- Adversarial validation with consensus is unique

## Improvement Opportunities

1. **TDD Enforcement**: HIGH impact, prevents broken code from accumulating
   - Current: Not enforced
   - Proposed: Create skill with strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
   - Risk: LOW (additive change)

2. **Two-Stage Review**: HIGH impact, better issue categorization
   - Current: Single-pass adversarial
   - Proposed: Spec compliance -> Code quality
   - Risk: LOW (additive change)

3. **Systematic Debugging**: HIGH impact, better fix rate
   - Current: Ad-hoc debugging
   - Proposed: 4-phase mandatory process
   - Risk: LOW (additive change)

4. **Stop Verification**: MEDIUM impact, ensures completion
   - Current: Manual VERIFIED_DONE
   - Proposed: Automatic checklist hook
   - Risk: LOW (additive change)

## Conclusion

Both tools offer valuable patterns that complement Ralph's existing strengths:

- **planning-with-files** excels at context persistence and goal tracking
- **superpowers** excels at development discipline (TDD, debugging, reviews)
- **Ralph** excels at multi-model orchestration and automatic context preservation

The recommended integrations focus on development discipline from superpowers (TDD, systematic debugging, two-stage review) and goal tracking from planning-with-files (Stop hook, 2-action rule).

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Create `systematic-debugging` skill (HIGH priority)
2. Create `test-driven-development` skill (HIGH priority)
3. Enhance `/adversarial` with two-stage review (HIGH priority)
4. Add Stop hook verification (MEDIUM priority)
