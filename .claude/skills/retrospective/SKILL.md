# Skill: Retrospective & Self-Improvement

**ultrathink** - Take a deep breath. We're not here to write code. We're here to make a dent in the universe.

## The Vision
Every retrospective should make the system inevitable and better.

## Your Work, Step by Step
1. **Summarize outcomes**: Task, complexity, iterations, models.
2. **Analyze effectiveness**: Routing, clarification, and agents.
3. **Identify gaps**: Missed checks or friction.
4. **Propose improvements**: Concrete, minimal changes.

## Ultrathink Principles in Practice
- **Think Different**: Question the status quo.
- **Obsess Over Details**: Use evidence, not guesses.
- **Plan Like Da Vinci**: Structure feedback before writing.
- **Craft, Don't Code**: Keep recommendations actionable.
- **Iterate Relentlessly**: Apply learnings immediately.
- **Simplify Ruthlessly**: Focus on the few changes that matter.

## Purpose
Analyze completed tasks to improve the Ralph Wiggum system.

## When to Use
MANDATORY after every task completion, before declaring VERIFIED_DONE.

## Analysis Categories

### 1. Routing Effectiveness
- Was the complexity classification accurate?
- Did the chosen model perform well?
- Should routing thresholds change?

### 2. Clarification Quality
- Were the right questions asked?
- Did any missed clarifications cause rework?
- Should question templates be updated?

### 3. Agent Performance
- Which subagents were most useful?
- Any agents that didn't add value?
- New agent patterns needed?

### 4. Quality Gate Effectiveness
- Did gates catch real issues?
- Any false positives/negatives?
- Missing validations?

### 5. Iteration Efficiency
- How many iterations were used?
- Could it have been done faster?
- Any wasted iterations?
